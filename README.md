## About

exploReddit is a subreddit recommendation system, that suggests new subreddits for you to explore based on your commenting and submission history on Reddit.

## Installation

To run exploReddit, you will require the NumPy and SciPy libraries. Installation instructions for both can be found [here](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html). You do not need to install the entire SciPy stack. Alternatively, you can install them from ```pip``` using the following commands:

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential gfortran libatlas-base-dev python-pip python-dev
sudo pip install --upgrade pip
sudo pip install numpy
sudo pip install scipy
```

You will also need to install [PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper)](http://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Once again, ```pip``` makes installing easy:

```
sudo pip install praw
```

## Running

To get subreddit recommendations, download the source, unzip and navigate to the project directory, and run ```python src/getRecommendations.py```. Enter your Reddit username, find some new subreddits you'll enjoy, start browsing them and get that sweet, sweet karma!
